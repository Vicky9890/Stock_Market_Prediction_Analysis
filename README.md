# Stock Prediction Analysis using Linear Regression Machine Learning Algorithm

This repository contains Python code for conducting stock prediction analysis using linear regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm. The analysis involves fetching historical stock data through yfinance, preprocessing it using Pandas and NumPy, implementing a linear regression model, and visualizing the predictions using Matplotlib.

## Stock Prediction

Stock prediction refers to the process of using historical data, statistical analysis, and various techniques, including machine learning algorithms, to forecast future movements or trends in stock prices. It is a challenging task due to the complex and often unpredictable nature of financial markets. Stock prediction can be approached using different methodologies, including fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and machine learning-based predictive modeling.

## About DGCONTENT.NS Stock Data

I am using DGCONTENT.NS data for train the model.

**Ticker Symbol:** "DGCONTENT.NS" refers to the stock symbol for a specific company or asset listed on the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE).

**Data Source:** The historical stock data for "DGCONTENT.NS" is obtained from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance Python library. This data includes daily open, high, low, close prices, and trading volumes for a specific time range.

**Role in Analysis:** The "DGCONTENT.NS" stock data is utilized as a primary dataset for conducting stock prediction analysis within this project.
